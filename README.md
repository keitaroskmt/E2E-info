Supplementary codes for our paper ["End-to-End Training Induces Information Bottleneck through Layer-Role Differentiation: A Comparative Analysis with Layer-wise Training"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=O3wmRh2SfT&noteId=3X3EJITPUQ), TMLR2024.

It provides useful implementations for **various layer-wise training methods** and **HSIC-based analyses**.

## TODO List
#### Training Algorithms
- [x] Sequential layer-wise training
- [ ] Signal Propagation
- [ ] Forward-Forward algorithm

#### Architecture
- [x] ResNet
- [x] VGG
- [ ] Vision transformer
